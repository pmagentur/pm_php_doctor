      Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is stored
      in memory and used to ask the Github API for a list of files changed in
      the PR.
      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
      Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
